# Wine_Recommendation
Introduction
Based on the wine information data, the purpose of this project is to cluster customers and suggest similar/new items to increase market profit and better convenience for customers.
There are 2 different methods to suggest wine based on customers’ purchase type preferences (similar/new).
1. Customers will purchase similar products based on their last purchase.
2. Customers will take an adventure and purchase new items.

And by using R, the following will be the conclusion.
Conclusion
1) Use ‘Euclidean Distance’ to recommend similar wine.
2) Use either ‘Kmeans’ or ‘Hierarchial clustering’ to recommend different type of wine.
