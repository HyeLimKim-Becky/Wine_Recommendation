# Wine_Recommendation
* Based on the wine information data, the purpose of this project is to cluster customers and suggest similar/new items to increase market profit and better convenience for customers.
* There are 2 different methods to suggest wine based on customers’ purchase type preferences (similar/new).
      1. Customers will purchase similar products based on their last purchase.
      2. Customers will take an adventure and purchase new items.

* Based on this model, the following will be the conclusion:
      1. Use ‘Euclidean Distance’ to recommend similar wine.
      2. Use either ‘Kmeans’ or ‘Hierarchial clustering’ to recommend different type of wine.
